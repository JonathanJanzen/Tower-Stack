# Tower-Stack
Final project for SFWRENG 2XA3 Fall 2018, written in assembly.

The task was to write a program in assembly (```sorthem.asm```) that would take an input argument beween 2 and 9 and generate a randomised tower on the screen. Then, with every press of a key, the tower would autmomatically sort itself in order from greatest to least (from bottom to top). We were given all files except for ```sorthem.asm```, which we were expected to write. Writing such a project in assembly helped give me significantly more perspective on how some higher level languages work.
